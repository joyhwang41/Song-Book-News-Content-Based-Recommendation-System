# Content-Based-Recommendation-System
In the era of information overload, users often face difficulty in finding relevant content. In such a scenario, recommender systems play a crucial role in providing personalized recommendations. With the increasing availability of user data, the need for advanced recommender systems has become more important than ever. The aim of this project is to build a content-based recommender system for music and podcasts that utilizes the NYTimes, Penguin, and Spotify APIs to collect user engagement data and provide personalized recommendations.
The project utilizes the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze the textual content of NYTimes articles, Spotify songs, and Penguin podcasts. By applying vectorization to the textual data, similarities between articles and songs/podcasts of similar flavor are calculated. This approach enables the system to make personalized recommendations based on user engagement history and the similarity of their interests.
